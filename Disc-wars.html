                        The <b>Disc Wars</b> is one of many gladiatorial events played out in the Game Arena, where programs are placed into separate compartments
                        and forced to fight using their <b>Identity Discs</b> for the amusement of a vast, cheering crowd. A program struck by an opponent's disc or
                        cast from the ring via a broken floor-plate immediately derezzes, losing the game. Gravity on the arena platforms can be reversed by
                        small spherical devices which maintain normal gravity when moved one way and reverse it when moved the other. A change in gravity is
                        signaled by a dial on the side of the ring.<br>Multiple Disc Wars matches play out at one time, with the winners pitted against one another until the last survivor faces the Final Round.</p>

                        Identity Discs (or Light Discs) are the most fundamental piece of equipment to programs in both the Game Grid and in the Tron system. They contain all that a program is, in the form of a detachable
                        glowing disc normally worn on the upper back. Everything seen, heard, or otherwise experienced is recorded on the wearer's disc.<br><br>
                        Identity discs issued to Game Grid programs appear as solid discs with several concentric rings on the surface, glowing with their owners' circuitry color. The circuits glow more brightly when the disc is in use,
                         and have been seen to change size or flash on and off when active. In flight, old-system discs appear as uniform circular planes of light in their owners' circuitry color, trailing comet-like tails as they fly towards their targets.
                          Despite this appearance, they are still solid to one another, and ricochet from other discs with an audible clank.<br><br>

                        Identity discs in the Tron system appear as solid metallic rings, hollow in the center and colored white or black to match the wearer's garb, with a glowing line circling their inner edge,
                        again matching the circuitry color of their owners. The outer edge, when energized, flares into a brilliantly glowing nimbus of white light with a slight tint recalling the owner's circuitry color; this active edge causes faint
                        but visible ripples in the air when moved or thrown, and the air appears to shimmer around it when held still. These discs maintain their solid appearance while in flight, and generally behave like solid metal objects.
                         Unlike the old-system discs, which had no visible means of attachment to their owners' backs, they are fitted over circular docks which rest between the shoulders of the wearer.<br><br>

                        Broken discs in both systems emit lightning-like discharges of energy. In the Tron system, a program whose disc has been fractured is able to survive, and the shards may contain fragments of information known to the disc's owner.
                         The only discs currently known to have been broken, belonging to Sark and Abraxas, were broken by impacts from other discs. Losing one's disk does not mean immediate death to a program, but he/she will be subject to termination by the Grid's security.
                          <b>Rinzler</b>, despite losing both his discs, was still able to remain functional.
